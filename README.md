# developer-primer

This project serves as a practice repository for new Tudat Developers following the [Tudat Developer Documentation](https://tudat-developer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Feel free to practice the primer topics as many times as you need. This repository has one purpose, and one 
purpose only: let you practice your developer skills, messy is ok! 😁
